TESTING TO-DO
=============
[ ] Map appears after user submits form with address and checked categories (did a map appear?)

[ ] When a user submits with blank address field, an error is displayed "Please enter an address" and user is not redirected to the results page

[ ] When user submits form with no categories checked, select all categories and return map (check params)

[ ] valid address test:
(can google maps handle this?)
1) it is an address or intersection
2) it is located in the 5 boroughs
      desired behaviors:
      -if user enters invalid address, display error "Please enter valid address"
      -No redirect
