   <p>The city of New York maintains a large database of social service agencies. Until now, there was no simple way for ordinary people to browse, filter, or view them. Helpfrog aims to provide the missing link between the open data portal and regular New Yorkers. Just enter an address or intersection, choose one or more categories, and we'll show you a map and list of the nearest resources.</p>
